## This is a file for wrangling the second set of collected datasets

## Importing the datasets on the premier league players

```{r, import}
library(readxl)
FPL_201617 <- read_excel("~/DSI-SRP FILES/FPL 2016-17.xlsx")
FPL_201718 <- read_excel("~/DSI-SRP FILES/FPL 2017-18.xlsx")
FPL_201819 <- read_excel("~/DSI-SRP FILES/FPL 2018-19.xlsx")
Prem_201617 <- read_excel("~/DSI-SRP FILES/Premier League 2016-17.xlsx")
Prem_201718 <- read_excel("~/DSI-SRP FILES/Premier League 2017-18.xlsx")
Prem_201819 <- read_excel("~/DSI-SRP FILES/Premier League 2018-19.xlsx")
```

## Loading tidyverse
```{r, packages}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Merging the datasets with the use of inner_join

```{r, merge}
Prem_201617 <- as_tibble(Prem_201617)
play17 <- inner_join(Prem_201617, FPL_201617, by = c(player_name = "Full Name"))
play18 <- inner_join(Prem_201718, FPL_201718, by = c(player_name = "Full Name"))
play19 <- inner_join(Prem_201819, FPL_201819, by = c(player_name = "Full Name"))
```

## Transforming elements in the position variable into factors
```{r, pos-to-fac}
play17$position <- as_factor(play17$position)
levels(play17$position)
play18$position <- as_factor(play18$position)
levels(play18$position)
play19$position <- as_factor(play19$position)
levels(play19$position)
```

## Creating function called position_indexer that builds a new column called position_index which indexes the position of the players.

```{r, pos-index}
position_indexer <- function(df) {
  df %>% 
    mutate(position_index = if_else(position %in% c("Goalkeeper"),
1,if_else(position %in% c("Centre-Back", "Left-Back", "Right-Back"),
2,if_else(position %in% c("Defensive Midfield", "Central Midfield", "Left Midfield", 
"Right Midfield", "Midfielder"),
3,if_else(position %in% c("Left Winger","Right Winger","Attacking Midfield"),
4,if_else(position %in% c("Forward", "Second Striker", "Centre-Forward"),5,0))))))
}
```

## Applying position indexer to the three datasets
``` {r}
play17 <- position_indexer(play17)
play18 <- position_indexer(play18)
play19 <- position_indexer(play19)
```

## Saving the datasets as csv files
```{r, save-file}
write_csv(play17, "season17.csv")
write_csv(play18, "season18.csv")
write_csv(play19, "season19.csv")
```
