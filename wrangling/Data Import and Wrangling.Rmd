# This is a file for wrangling the collected datasets

## FIFA 17, FIFA 18 and FIFA 19 files which contained players' attributes were first imported.

```{r, import}
FIFA.17 <- read.csv("~/DSI-SRP FILES/FIFA 17.csv")
FIFA.18 <- read.csv("~/DSI-SRP FILES/FIFA 18.csv")
FIFA.19 <- read.csv("~/DSI-SRP FILES/FIFA 19.csv")
```


## Loading packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Fantasy Premier League files from the season of 2016-17 to 2018-19 which contained players' attributes and performance were also imported. 

```{r, import 2}
library(readxl)
FPL_201617 <- read_excel("~/DSI-SRP FILES/FPL 2016-17.xlsx")
FPL_201718 <- read_excel("~/DSI-SRP FILES/FPL 2017-18.xlsx")
FPL_201819 <- read_excel("~/DSI-SRP FILES/FPL 2018-19.xlsx")

```

## The imported datasets were wrangled in order to include important rows and columns only

```{r, new-df}
create_new <- function(df) {
  df %>% 
    mutate(Full_Name = as.character(Full.Name)) %>%
    select(Full_Name, age, overall, potential, player_positions, club)
}

FIFA.17_new <- create_new(FIFA.17)
FIFA.18_new <- create_new(FIFA.18)
FIFA.19_new <- create_new(FIFA.19)
```

## The newly formed FIFA datasets were merged with the FPL datasets

```{r, merge-data}
season19 <- inner_join(FIFA.19_new, FPL_201819, by = c(Full_Name = "Full Name"))
season18 <- inner_join(FIFA.18_new, FPL_201718, by = c(Full_Name = "Full Name"))
season17 <- inner_join(FIFA.17_new, FPL_201617, by = c(Full_Name = "Full Name"))
```

## Further wrangling was used to separate the player positions' columns into multiple columns. This made players with multiple positions have one position.

```{r, warning= FALSE}
season17 <- season17 %>%
  separate(player_positions, into = c("Position1", "Position2", "Position3"), sep = ",")
season18 <- season18 %>%
  separate(player_positions, into = c("Position1", "Position2", "Position3"), sep = ",")
season19 <- season19 %>%
  separate(player_positions, into = c("Position1", "Position2", "Position3"), sep = ",")
```

## The two additional columns were deleted in order to get rid of missing values

```{r, drop-cols}
remove_2p <- function(df) {
  df %>% 
    select(-Position2,-Position3)
}
season17 <- remove_2p(season17)
season18 <- remove_2p(season18)
season19 <- remove_2p(season19)
```

## Converting the players' positions' data type to factor and obtaining the unique levels of player positions

```{r, pos-to-fac}
season17$Position1 <- as_factor(season17$Position1)
season18$Position1 <- as_factor(season18$Position1)
season19$Position1 <- as_factor(season19$Position1)
levels(season17$Position1)
levels(season18$Position1)
levels(season19$Position1)
```

## Creating a function that indexes players' positions
```{r, pos-index}
position_indexer <- function(df) {
  df %>% 
    mutate(position_index = if_else(
      Position1 == "GK", '1',if_else(Position1 %in% c("CB", "LWB", "RWB", "LB", "RB"), 
'2', if_else(Position1 %in% c("CM", "CDM", "RM", "CAM", "LM"), 
'3', if_else(Position1 %in% c("RW", "LW", "ST", "CF"), 
'4', '0')))))
}
```

## Applying the function above to the datasets

```{r}
season17 <- position_indexer(season17)
season18 <- position_indexer(season18)
season19 <- position_indexer(season19)
```

## Converting position index data type to double 

```{r,pos-index_to-double}
season17$position_index <- as.double(season17$position_index)
season18$position_index <- as.double(season18$position_index)
season19$position_index <- as.double(season19$position_index)
```

## Saving files as csv files

```{r, save-file}
write_csv(season17, "players17.csv")
write_csv(season18, "players18.csv")
write_csv(season19, "players19.csv")
```
