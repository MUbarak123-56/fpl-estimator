```{r, packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
```

## Loading the datasets

```{r, load}
s17_1 <- read.csv("~/DSI-SRP1/season2017.csv", encoding = "UTF-8")
s17_2 <- read.csv("~/DSI-SRP1/FPL_2016.csv")

  df2 <- df2 %>% 
    rename(c(player_name = name))
  df1 <- df %>% 
    select(player_name, club_name, position_index, position, season)
  df1$player_name <- as.character(df1$player_name)
  df2$player_name <- as.character(df2$player_name)
  df4 <- inner_join(df2, df1, by = "player_name")
  return(df4)
}

```

## Premier League 2016/17

```{r, 2016/17}
s17_2 <- s17_2 %>% 
  separate(name, into = c("first", "last"), "_")
s17_2 <- s17_2 %>% 
  unite(name, first,last, sep = " ")
s17_3 <- fpl_merge(s17_1,s17_2)

## Function for cumulatively adding specific columns

```{r, accumulated function}
accumulated <- function(df) {
  df %>% 
    mutate(n = 1) %>% 
    group_by(player_name,club_name) %>% 
    mutate(goals_scored =cumsum(goals_scored) - goals_scored, 
           assists =cumsum(assists) - assists,
           ict_index =cumsum(ict_index) - ict_index ,
           goals_conceded =cumsum(goals_conceded) - goals_conceded,
           minutes =cumsum(minutes) - minutes, 
           own_goals =cumsum(own_goals) - own_goals, 
           total_points =cumsum(total_points), bps =cumsum(bps)-bps,
           clean_sheets =cumsum(clean_sheets)-clean_sheets, 
           bonus = cumsum(bonus)- bonus,
           GW = cumsum(n)) %>% 
    select(player_name, club_name, position, position_index, goals_scored,
           assists, ict_index, goals_conceded, minutes, own_goals,
           total_points, bps, bonus, clean_sheets, GW, season) %>% 
    filter(ict_index > 0)
}
```

## Applying the functions on the datasets

```{r, applying function}
year17 <- accumulated(data17)
year18 <- accumulated(data18)
year19 <- accumulated(data19)
```

## Cleaning datasets

## function for removing duplicate players' record

```{r, rem_dup}
rem_dup <- function(df) {
  df %>% 
    group_by(GW) %>% 
    distinct(player_name, .keep_all = TRUE)
}

```

```{r, cleaning the datasets}
year19 <- year19 %>% 
  filter(player_name != "Danny Ward")
year17 <- rem_dup(year17)
year18 <- rem_dup(year18)
year19 <- rem_dup(year19)
```

## Number of rows in each dataset

```{r, nrow}
nrow(year17)
nrow(year18)
nrow(year19)
```

## Saving the newly datasets to csv files

```{r, saving new datasets}
write.csv(year17, "FPL_2016_17_new.csv")
write.csv(year18, "FPL_2017_18_new.csv")
write.csv(year19, "FPL_2018_19_new.csv")
```

## Variable selector

```{r, var_sel}
var_sel <- function(df) {
  df %>% 
    select(player_name, club_name, position, position_index, goals_scored,
           assists, ict_index, goals_conceded, minutes, own_goals,
           total_points, bps, bonus, clean_sheets, season)
}
```

## Creating a dataset that combines the three seasons and cumulatively adds up certain rows

## Creating a new accumulated function

```{r, accumulated2}
accumulated2 <- function(df) {
  df %>% 
    mutate(n = 1) %>% 
    group_by(player_name,club_name) %>% 
    mutate(goals_scored =cumsum(goals_scored), 
           assists =cumsum(assists),
           ict_index =cumsum(ict_index),
           goals_conceded =cumsum(goals_conceded),
           minutes =cumsum(minutes), 
           own_goals =cumsum(own_goals), 
           total_points =cumsum(total_points), bps =cumsum(bps),
           clean_sheets =cumsum(clean_sheets), 
           bonus = cumsum(bonus),
           GW = cumsum(n)) %>% 
    select(player_name, club_name, position, position_index, goals_scored,
           assists, ict_index, goals_conceded, minutes, own_goals,
           total_points, bps, bonus, GW, clean_sheets, season) %>% 
    filter(ict_index > 0)
}

```

## Selecting important rows

```{r, 3seasons}
data17 <- var_sel(data17)
data18 <- var_sel(data18)
data19 <- var_sel(data19)
year3 <- rbind(data17, data18,data19)
year3 <- accumulated2(year3)
year3
```

### Cleaning the cumulated season dataset

```{r, 3seasons-clean}
year3 <- year3 %>% 
  filter(player_name != "Danny Ward")
year3 <- rem_dup(year3)
nrow(year3)
```

```{r, save_3seasons}
write.csv(year3, "~/DSI-SRP1/FPL_ULTIMATE.csv")
```

### 2019/20 sample dataset

```{r, 2019-20}
library(readxl)
data <- read_excel("~/DSI-SRP1/2019_20_sample.xlsx")
head(data)
write.csv(data, "~/DSI-SRP1/2019_20_sample.csv")

```
