## This is a file for conductiong explorative data analysis of the premier league players' dataset

## Importing the datasets
```{r, load-data}
season17 <- read.csv("~/DSI-SRP1/season17.csv", encoding="UTF-8")
season18 <- read.csv("~/DSI-SRP1/season18.csv", encoding="UTF-8")
season19 <- read.csv("~/DSI-SRP1/season19.csv", encoding="UTF-8")
```

## Loading the tidyverse package

```{r, packages}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Calculating correlation coefficients between goal scored and total FPL points
```{r, cor}
message("Correlation between goal scored and total fpl points for 2016/17: ",
        with(season17, cor(goals_scored,total_points)))
message("Correlation between goal scored and total fpl points for 2017/18: ",
        with(season18, cor(goals_scored,total_points)))
message("Correlation between goal scored and total fpl points for 2018/19: ",
        with(season19, cor(goals_scored,total_points)))
```

## Changing the datatype of the position_index to factor
```{r, pos_ind}
season17$position_index <- as_factor(season17$position_index)
season18$position_index <- as_factor(season18$position_index)
season19$position_index <- as_factor(season19$position_index)
```

## Creating a funtion to calculate a new metric called total fpl points to game played
```{r, fpl_to_game}
fpl_to_gaming <- function(df) {
  df %>% 
    mutate(fpl_to_game = (total_points/minutes.played)*90)
}
season17 <- fpl_to_gaming(season17)
season18 <- fpl_to_gaming(season18)
season19 <- fpl_to_gaming(season19)
```

## Scatter plots graph to highlight how the goals scored vary with fpl points
```{r, gs_vs_fpl_points}
ggplot(season17, aes(goals_scored, total_points)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = position_index)) + 
  labs(title = "Total FPL points vs Goal Scored in 2016/17")
ggplot(season18, aes(goals_scored, total_points)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = position_index)) + 
  labs(title = "Total FPL points vs Goal Scored in 2017/18")
ggplot(season19, aes(goals_scored, total_points)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = position_index)) + 
  labs(title = "Total FPL points vs Goal Scored in 2018/19")
```

## Bar graphs to show how the number of players vary per team with regards to position
```{r, pos_bar-gs}
position_bar <- function(df) {
  df %>% 
    ggplot(aes(club_name)) +

    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
    labs(title = sprintf("How players' positions varied across teams in
                         %s", unique(df$season)))
}
```

## Plotting the bar charts

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 9}
position_bar(season17)
position_bar(season18)
position_bar(season19)
```

    labs(title = sprintf("How goal scored varied across different positions 
                         in %s", unique(df$season))) +
    coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,35))
